            <p>
                I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Business. 
                I am currently working on becoming better with React and other popular 
                frameworks in hopes of landing my first full-time developer job. 
            </p>
        </div>
    );
